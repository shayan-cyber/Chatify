## Tech Stack

**Client:** React,Vite, Typescript, TailwindCSS

**Server:** Node, Express, MongoDB, Cloudinary

### Why Did I choose Cloudinary?
#### Needed to save the uploaded images , using server's disk storage is not optimal cause it'll increase the resources consumed my server system, So went for Cloudinary to save those images and get a url to save in mongoDB table.
